Here is a couple of fixes for Snes9x 1.60, I did them because I wanted to update my "junkbase" from 1.53 to MSU1-compatible version.

Many macros were removed, but the rigorous service is FAR FROM COMPLETION, as there are many CPU quirks and whatsoever you can find in this code. I DO NOT RECOMMEND using Snes9x for that neither I will keep going on, because of the unsolved licensing issue within the emulator.

This modding has worse timing problems at screen rendering, because it is faster than the original stuff (check SeiKen DenSetsu 3 intro and assorted mode 7 stuff to notice the tearing). I am pretty sure nothing "crashfull" came but you can never be 100%, so take care...

This tree holds only the changed files, everything you need to compile can be guessed by reading the Makefile.
